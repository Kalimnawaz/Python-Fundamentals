# Python Fundamentals

Welcome to the **Python Fundamentals** repository! This collection is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners master the basics of Python programming through hands-on Jupyter Notebooks, clear explanations, and practical examples.

## Repository Structure

- **Day1, Day2, ...**  
  Each folder (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.) contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) focused on a specific topic or set of concepts in Python. Work through them sequentially to build a solid programming foundation.

## Topics Covered

- Python syntax and variables
- Data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries
- String operations and formatting
- Control flow (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions and methods
- Whitespace management
- Python best practices (including the Zen of Python)
- And much more!

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kalimnawaz/Python-Fundamentals.git
    cd Python-Fundamentals
    ```

2. **Install Requirements**
    - Make sure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter installed.
    - You can install Jupyter via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install notebook
        ```

3. **Run the Notebooks**
    - Start Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    - Navigate to the desired day/folder and open the `.ipynb` file.
    - Run the cells and explore the code examples.

## Who Is This For?

- Beginners eager to learn Python programming from scratch.
- Intermediate learners seeking to solidify their understanding of core Python concepts.
